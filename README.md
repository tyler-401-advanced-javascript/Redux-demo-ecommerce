#  Redux Demo App

Introducing myself to redux through the making of this super basic single page application. 

## Use

Clone and `npm i`. 

npm start.

Use the select menu to select a filter. 

Note that the Select and the Results are in different components, and they dont explicitly receive hard-coded props. Yet they interact! This is redux! Cool times.
